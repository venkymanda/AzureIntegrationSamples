## Introduction

In the world of modern application development and cloud computing, integrations play a critical role. This repository aims to provide you with hands-on examples and guidance on integrating various systems and services using Azure.

## Azure Functions

Azure Functions are a serverless compute service that allow you to run event-driven code without having to manage infrastructure. In this section, you'll find code samples and explanations for using Azure Functions in integration scenarios.

- Sample 1: [Basic HTTP Triggered Azure Function for Isolated Worker Process using Dependency Injection](Azure%20Functions/IsolatedExample)
- Sample 2: [Basic HTTP Triggered Azure Function for Inprocess Worker Process using Dependency Injection](Azure%20Functions/InprocessSample)

## Durable Functions

Durable Functions are an extension of Azure Functions that enable you to write stateful and long-running orchestrations in a serverless environment. Explore how to use Durable Functions for complex integration scenarios.

- Sample 1: [Orchestrating Multiple Azure Functions](durable-functions/sample1)
- Sample 2: [Human Interaction with Durable Functions](durable-functions/sample2)

## Logic App Patterns

Azure Logic Apps provide a low-code way to automate workflows and integrate services and systems. Discover various patterns and templates for creating Logic Apps that streamline your business processes.

- Pattern 1: [File Integration with Logic Apps](logic-app-patterns/pattern1)
- Pattern 2: [Approval Workflow with Adaptive Cards](logic-app-patterns/pattern2)

## Best Practices

Building enterprise-level integrations requires adherence to best practices. Learn from our experiences and find guidance on how to design, deploy, and maintain robust integrations.
